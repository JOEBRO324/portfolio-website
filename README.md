# portfolio-website

This will be a portfolio website that showcases and implements all of my new coding projects into one place, regardless of the programming language.

I will be making the entire website from scratch, so that I can showcase my ability to learn new things and refine my skills that I already have.

To get me back into coding, I will be making a few simple applications to start out, such as:
* Website Connectivity Checker - a simple yet useful tool that uses data scraping
* Content Aggregator - a tool that showcases some personal aspects of my life
* Quiz Application - a fun and interactive way to test your knowledge

For more intermediate projects, I will be attempting to create these:
* Drawing Application - a tool that enables the user to draw pictures, and uses SQL DB to store and retrieve drawings*
* URL Shortener - a useful tool that allows the shortening of URLs

The only advanced project that I will be at least attempting will be creating my own programming language from scratch. 
I want to make a language that uses minimal characters for syntax, so as to not be super data hungry, and will be able to process functions as quickly as possible.
No other languages will be implemented for basic functions; some languages use C for basic functions, and I want to avoid doing that, so that this language is entirely created by me.

Creating the webpage will be the first milestone, so Iâ€™ll have a place to show my work. After that is done, I will begin implementing my projects and will continue adding on to show my progress.
